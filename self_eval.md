# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
    A lot more confident now than at the beginning of the day after spending some time on it with kvg.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
    Decently confident, I just liken it to something I have experience with or in a way that is easy to understand.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
    Decently confident, it's similar to troubleshooting in electrical that I have experience with "if this, then that".

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
    I think ,in general, I just need more experience with the material, more repitions more "plug and play" examples. Tinkering with it on my own to see the nuts and bolts of the language operations will help clear questions I have and create new ones as I'm working.

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
    I am not even aware of what questions I have at this point, if I'm being honest. However, as they pop up I will use the resources available such as, google, mod0 lessons, other classmates and turing staff.
